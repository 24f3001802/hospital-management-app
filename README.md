🏥 Hospital Management System – App Dev I Project (Sept 2025)
This project is a role-based web application designed to streamline hospital operations by managing patients, doctors, appointments, and treatments. Built using Flask (backend), Jinja2, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (frontend), and SQLite (database), the system supports three user roles: Admin, Doctor, and Patient.

🔧 Core Features:
Admin Dashboard: View total doctors, patients, appointments; manage profiles; search and blacklist users.

Doctor Dashboard: View appointments, update availability, record diagnosis and prescriptions, access patient history.

Patient Dashboard: Register/login, search doctors by specialization, book/cancel appointments, view treatment history.

🧠 Functional Highlights:
Dynamic appointment status updates (Booked → Completed → Cancelled)

Conflict prevention for overlapping appointments

Programmatic database creation (no manual DB setup)

Optional APIs for CRUD operations and charting (e.g., Chart.js)

Secure login system using Flask extensions

📁 Tech Stack:
Backend: Flask

Frontend: Jinja2, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap

Database: SQLite (programmatically created)
